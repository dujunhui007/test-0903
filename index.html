    <h3>Asch is an efficient, flexible, and safe decentralized application platform designed to lower the threshold for developers</h3>
    <span></span>
    <p class="content1">Asch is an efficient, flexible, and safe decentralized application platform designed to lower the threshold for developers. Using JavaScript as the programming language and relational database to store data, ASCH is increasing the similarities between developing a DAPP and a traditional web application. Asch appeals to both developers and businesses because it offers a strong platform where prosperousness of the "ecology" has direct relation with the developer's productivity. Asch is open in design and can be customized for many uses including finance, document storage, and copyright certificates. The APIs are underlying and abstract, and they can be combined freely to achieve a variety of applications. Asch has implemented an inherited and enhanced the DPOS algorithm, greatly reducing the probability of forking and risk of double spending. Asch's side chain, i.e. the application mode, not only delays the expansion of the blockchain but also makes DAPPs more flexible and personalized. Asch is a forward-looking, low-cost and one-stop application solution.
    </p>
    <h3>The services Asch platform provides include a public chain – also called the main-chain - and a set of application SDKs</h3>
    <span></span>
    <p class="content2">The services Asch platform provides include a public chain – also called the main-chain - and a set of application SDKs.
        The Asch application SDKs can be used to develop side-chain applications - blockchain applications with a free-running, immutable ledger.
        The side-chain can communicate with the main-chain through the built-in cross-chain protocol of the application SDK. In other words, the main-chain has the function of asset routing, which means a variety of assets can flow among different applications. Asch's ecological system contains multiple chains; each chain can carry multiple tokens or assets, and each token or asset can be transferred to multiple chains.

            <li>
                <span>Application management</span>
                <p>Applications need to register meta-information into the main-chain before issuing it. The meta-information includes the name and description of the application, initial witness, and relevant configuration information for the asset routing. Users can browse, retrieve, trace, download and visit the decentralized application through the module.

                <span>Asset routing</span>
                <p>The assets registered on the main-chain can communicate with each application by cross-chain. Although applications are separated from each other, the flow of value could be realized through the asset routing function of the main-chain.</p>

                <p>Each account with tokens on the Asch main-chain can be registered as a delegate, i.e. a "witness". The top 101 delegates have the opportunities to be the system's account owners who have the right of forging (mining). The account owners can push up their rankings by the token holders' vote.

            <li>
                <span>Account management</span>
                <p>Account model is adopted at the lower level of Asch chain. Each private key corresponds to an account in which basic user information such as wallet address, public key and nickname, and other configuration information or statistical information are stored. As all application chains use the same account model, an account on the Asch chain can use the functions of all applications directly.</p>

    <p>We believe that the blockchain itself is essentially a distributed database without a traditional central administrator, regardless of changes brought by the blockchain technology to Internet and social organization structure. The data is organized on the blockchain and immutable for cryptographical principles. All business logics that can be realized by traditional database. For example, mySql and Oracle can be realized on blockchain. The only concern is the necessity of using the blockchain technology. Is there a trust issue in your business scenario? Does your business need to be decentralized? Is it necessary to build a more effective incentive mechanism by using a blockchain token? If your answer is yes, then Asch will satisfy your demand.
    </p>
    <!--<p>The data is organized in blockchain and anti-tampering by using cryptography.</p>-->
    <!--<p>Asch platform can be applied to the following application scenarios, but is not limited to them.</p>-->
    <h3>Asch platform can be applied to the following application scenarios, but is not limited to them</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span>Content publishing platform</span>
            <span>Key words:</span>
            <span>token incentive, value delivery, collective intelligence</span>
            <p>In the field of Internet, tycoons deliver the captivating content to users by analyzing their reading habits. While winning users' favors, the algorithm also creates a niche deprives their right of choice and cognizance. By using the decentralization feature of blockchain, the most interesting news in the community can be selected via collective intelligence. Meanwhile, the token incentive mechanism can be applied as the economic mechanism can stimulate the participants' enthusiasm and solve the problem that quality content is difficult to be identified and realized. Thus, the value will return to its creators and deliverers, and can be shared by all the participants.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Market prediction</span>
            <span>Key words:</span>
            <span> token incentive, value delivery, public participation</span>
            <p>Market prediction is to collect the confidence and judgments from different parties on the same event according to the market principles, thereby predict the future result of that event. The problems of insufficient credibility existing in traditional prediction platforms can be solved by blockchain as it is distributed, open, transparent and immutable. Therefore, a credible, autonomous, value-transitive and extensible market prediction platform will be established. The platform can predict the upcoming events with the aid of the superior intelligence derived from the large-scale cooperation. Meanwhile, the built-in token incentive would appeal to the public.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Exchange platform</span>
            <span>Key words:</span>
            <span>safety, decentralization, low fee, anonymity, scalability</span>
            <p>The exchange platform based on the blockchain distributed technology is an important part of Asch's ecology. Asch is a new generation blockchain application platform based on the side-chain technology. On the platform, a number of excellent projects and various types of tokens will be created. At the moment, the Asch Exchange Platform is the basic requirement for majority users. The exchange platform possesses several features such as decentralization, disintermediation, safety, low fees, anonymity, and scalability that other exchange platforms do not have. In the late phase, Bitcoin, Etherium and other global high-quality projects can be connected to realize the circulation of digital assets while eliminating the application isolation among them.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Social media</span>
            <span>Key words:</span>
            <span>value network, data, private</span>
            <p>Internet-based social media companies plunder users’ production data and unilaterally consume users by forcible users’ protocols. Users are not fully benefit from their work such as creating, establishing and maintaining their own community. A, social media based on the blockchain distributed technology is the future trend. Through the decentralization of the blockchain, the elimination of the predator and the freedom of the data and value can be achieved. Hence, the development of the entire ecosystem will be promoted by establishing a complete, positive-feedback value incentive economic system via the built-in token mechanism.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>IP Copyright protection</span>
            <span>Key words:</span>
            <span>tractability, value incentive</span>
            <p>The surging in popularity of the IP economy leads more people to recognize the importance of IP. An IP mostly comes from literary work, which highlights the importance of copyright. However, the largest obstacle of the copyright protection is to provide comprehensive protection when obtaining evidence in intermediate links as the links are uncontrollable. The traceability and immutableness of blockchain can reduce piracy greatly and protect the whole ecological cycle. At the same time, the affirmative right in process of work creation can also be stored in the blockchain permanently, which could be the evidence for future dispute resolution.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Public donation</span>
            <span>Key words:</span>
            <span>transparency, safety, decentralization</span>
            <p>The essence of public donation is the social wealth redistribution. The goal, the number and the execution procedures of wealth redistribution are determined by public organizations. Nowadays, the biggest contradiction between the public and non-profits is the donators’ demand for public donations and the credibility loss of those organizations. The inherent features of blockchain such as decentralization, transparency and immutableness expose all the donation and operation details to the public. Therefore, the distrust between donors and executors will be broke.
